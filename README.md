# Checkers â€” An exercise with querySelector and querySelectorAll
## Assignment Overview
This assignment demonstrates the use of querySelectors to manipulate elements of the DOM. On accepting this assignment from GitHub Classroom, you will follow the steps below to clone this repo to your local machine's Git repository. 

You will use the guidance in this week's lesson PDF to do the following:
1. Start the LiveServer in VS Code so that you can evaluate the program output.
2. Look over the index.html file to understand the structure of the checkerboard and where the black and red checkers are placed in the DOM.
3. Click the Build Board button. _Note the error message that it cannot select red/black squares._
4. Examine the selector syntax for another binding in this example:
```
  evenRowSquares = document.querySelectorAll(".even-row > div")
```
_NOTE: Notice that CSS selectors can be used to get a full NodeList of elements by combining selectors._

5. Examine the index.html file and locate the row container for each Red row. Each row has a unique ID that you can target with the right selector. 
6. Update the code for variable assignment of `redSquares` and `blackSquares`.

_ðŸ‘†HINT: You can get the direct decendents of each row by using the greater than symbol (>) as shown in the above example. But keep in mind two things: a) The CSS selector for a class looks different from that of an id attribute, and b) You will need to use a comma when including multiple items in your selection (selector1>div, selector2>div, and so on)._

7. Save your code and refresh the browser. _NOTE: LiveServer should reload your browser automatically. Address any error messages_
8. Click on the Build Board and Place Checkers buttons. _Address any error messages._

### Want An Added Challenge? (Optional) ###
If you found this exercise too easy and you have extra time, then try to add a new function that make the first move of the game. That is, you will advance a black checker to a legal spot on the board. Your function should execute __after__ the board has been set up. You might handle this asynchronous operation by adding a new button and attaching an event listener (or an OnClick= JavaScript function). Alternatively, you might just add your new function call at the end of the PlaceCheckers function.

Below is a hint, should you want one: 
```
// MOVE A PIECE
const moveOne = () => {
  const myChecker = document.querySelector("YOUR SELECTOR HERE");
  oddRowSquares[INDEXNUMBERHERE].appendChild(myChecker);
};
```

### Finishing Up ###
Once you have finished all steps, you will push a working branch of your code from your local machine back to this remote repository ("repo") on GitHub. To signal code readiness, you will open a pull request here on GitHub, which will result in an automatic notification to the instructor. 

The instructor will do the following: 
- Review your code and make any comments on your pull request
- Merge the accepted code into the "main" branch of the remote repo on GitHub
- Close the pull request 

## First Time Repo Configuration

1. Make sure you have Git installed on your local machine. You can check by typing this command in the terminal window:
    ```
    git status
    ```
2. If the git command is not recognized, then download and install Git for your respective operating system (Mac, Windows, etc.):
    [link to Git download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

3. Create a project dev folder called "checkers".

    *NOTE: This is where the code project will be housed. If you're on a Mac, then you should create this folder within the ðŸ”¨ Developer folder. If you're on Windows, you might want to create your dev folder somewhere within your Documents directory. You can create this folder by using the File Explorer (Windows) or the Finder (Mac). Alternatively, you can create it from the terminal window (like a boss) as follows.*  
    - Run `pwd` to reveal the current folder path. *Move to the right directory/folder within the terminal shell, as needed.* 
    - Run `mkdir checkers`. *The folder is created.*
    - Run `cd checkers`. *You are now in the new folder.* 

4. Clone the GitHub assignment repo into your new project dev folder:
    ```
    git clone --single-branch --branch main [assignment repo url] .
    ```
    *NOTE: Be certain to replace this â€” `[assignment repo URL]` â€” with your actual GitHub repo URL for this assignment, and **do not forget the trailing space and period**, which tells Git to use the current folder. For example:* 
    > `git clone --single-branch --branch main https://github.com/CS341W/checkers-John-Doe .`

5. Create a new branch called "dev-checkers" and perform a check-out with the following one-line command:
    ```
    git checkout -b dev-checkers
    ```
**Conclusion:** You are now ready to work in the "dev-checkers" branch of your local repository. When you have finished making code changes, then proceed to *Submitting Your Code via GitHub* below.

## Submitting Your Code via GitHub

1. Confirm that you're on the "dev-checkers" branch. If you're not sure, then use the following commands to a) see what branch you're on, and b) switch to "dev-checkers": 
    ```
    git branch
    git checkout dev-checkers
    ```
2. Make sure any new files have been added to the local repo. Use `git add` to add files/folders selectively, or use the global command:
   ```
   git add .
   ```
3. Commit any recent changes within your local repo â€” before pushing your code:
   ```
   git commit -a -m "[your custom message]"
   ```
    *NOTE: Remember to replace this `[your custom message]` with your own message, such as, "Adding new code for module."*

4. Push your code to the "dev-checkers" branch on the remote GitHub repository.

    *NOTE: If this is a first-time push, this action results in creation of the branch at the remote repo (GitHub) level; otherwise, this updates the existing "dev-checkers" branch on the remote repo.*
    ```
    git push origin dev-checkers
    ```
5. Log in at [https://github.com](https://github.com) and access this repo. 

    *NOTE: Your repo should appear in the left column when you log in. For more direct access, just follow the URL for this repo.* 
    
6. Perform the following steps to target your pull request: 
    - Click the "Pull requests" top menu link. *The Pull Requests panel appears.* 
    - Click the "New pull request" button. *The Compare Changes panel appears.*
    - Click the "compare" drop down-menu button. *A list of active branches appears.*
    - Click the "dev-checkers" branch name. *GitHub automatically evaluates the selected branch against the main branch for any conflicts. If there are no conflicts, then a green "able to merge" message is displayed.*
    - Click the "Create pull request" button. *The "Open a pull request" input panel appears.*
7. Perform the following steps to finalize and submit your pull request:
    - Type a brief 1-line description for the request, such as, "Submitting code for async functions and modules."
    - Use the "Write" textbox to leave any comments or questions about this exercise. Include the tag @CS341W-Admin to generate an alert to the instructor.
    - Click the "Submit" button.

**Conclusion:** You have completed the steps necessary to submit your code.
